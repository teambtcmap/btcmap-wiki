# Lightning Tips âš¡

There are lightning tip buttons in different places around BTC Map indicating that you can send a donation to one of our Shadowy Supertaggers for their contributions to the bitcoin mapping community.

## Receiving tips

In order to receive tips and have your tip button appear on BTC Map you need to complete a few steps first.

1. ### Create a [lightning address](https://lightningaddress.com/) or an [LNURL-pay](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc#lnurl-documents) string

- BTC Map supports either of these methods for accepting lightning payments. You can find a list of wallets that support both specs in the above links. You may already have a lightning address and not know, for example if you have a [stacker.news](https://stacker.news/) account you can find your lightning address on your profile page. It only takes a few clicks to setup a lightning address with many of the wallets linked above and you can share your address in other places online to receive tips there as well.

2. ### Add this information to your [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) user profile

- After logging into your OSM account, edit your profile description to include the following information: `[âš¡](lightning:btcmap@zbd.gg)`
- Replace `btcmap@zbd.gg` with your own lightning address or LNURL-pay string that you created in Step 1
- Save your changes by clicking `Update Profile`

That's it! ðŸ¥³ You are now ready to receive lightning tips to your wallet for your contributions.

You will need to make an edit on OSM after updating your profile for the data to sync with BTC Map and it may take up to 24 hours.

## Sending tips

To send lightning tips on BTC Map simply click on the Tip button and it will open any lightning enabled bitcoin wallet installed on your device. There are many lightning wallets to choose from. If you are using BTC Map on a desktop or laptop we recommend using the [Alby](https://getalby.com/) browser extension for the most seamless experience.
