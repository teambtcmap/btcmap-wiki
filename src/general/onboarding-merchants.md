**Hints and Tips**

- Simply ask "Cash or bitcoin" to raise awareness, particularly if you're a regular.
- Ask your server if they would like their tip (maybe double it!) in bitcoin and have them download a simple custodial wallet like [Wallet of Satoshi](https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/) to get started; non-custodial can wait.
- If you are speaking to the manager, don't necessarily try to Orange Pill them on day 1. Talk about bringing in more customers with very little effort.
