# Onboarding Merchants

**A collection of resources to help onboard new merchants with accepting bitcoin as payment. 🤝**

- [BTC Map Stickers!](https://github.com/teambtcmap/btcmap-general/tree/main/design/stickers)
- [Bitcoin for Local Business](https://bitcoinforlocalbusiness.com/)
- [Bridge 2 Bitcoin](https://bridge2bitcoin.com/) - UK-focused.

**Hints and Tips**

- Simply ask "Cash or bitcoin" to raise awareness, particularly if you're a regular.
- Ask your server if they would like their tip (maybe double it!) in bitcoin and have them download a simple custodial wallet like [Wallet of Satoshi](https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/) to get started; non-custodial can wait.
- If you are speaking to the manager, don't necessarily try to Orange Pill them on day 1. Talk about bringing in more customers with very little effort.

**Payment Providers**

There are a number of merchant solutions to help vendors take payment in bitcoin and optionally convert to local fiat:

- BTC Map! We have a web-based PoS (based on [LNBits](https://lnbits.com)) that works on many different devices.
- [Swiss Bitcoin Pay](https://swiss-bitcoin-pay.ch/)
- [Coinos](https://coinos.io/)
- [IBEX Pay](https://www.ibexpay.io/)
- [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
- [Pouch](https://pouch.ph/)
- [Galoy](https://galoy.io/)
- [Strike](https://strike.me/)
